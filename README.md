Simple-Jekyll-Search
====================

No additional gems required. 

Works out of the box. 

Fast, lightweight, super easy to set up and fully customizable with CSS!

#v2

Version 2 comes with improved *search* and *templating* engine!

#v3

But what if I don't want jQuery? No problem, I got you covered. `jekyll-search.js` is what you've been looking for on the second page of Google search results.
